DCACHE Cell Commands
====================

This is the reference to all (important) cell commands in DCACHE. You should not use any command not documented here, unless you really know what you are doing. Commands not in this reference are used for debugging by the developers.

This chapter serves two purposes: The other parts of this book refer to it, whenever a command is mentioned. Secondly, an administrator may check here, if he wonders what a command does.
